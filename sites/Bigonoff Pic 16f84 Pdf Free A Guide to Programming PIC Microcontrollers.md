## What are PIC microcontrollers?
  
PIC stands for Peripheral Interface Controller, and it is a type of microcontroller that is widely used in embedded systems and hobby projects. A microcontroller is a small computer that can execute instructions stored in its memory. Unlike a general-purpose computer, a microcontroller is designed to perform specific tasks and interact with external devices such as sensors, motors, LEDs, etc.
  
PIC microcontrollers are popular because they are cheap, easy to program, and have a large variety of models with different features and capabilities. Some of the advantages of PIC microcontrollers are:
  
- They have a simple and consistent instruction set that can be learned quickly.
- They have built-in peripherals such as timers, serial communication, analog-to-digital converters, etc. that simplify interfacing with external devices.
- They have low power consumption and can run on batteries for long periods of time.
- They have a large community of users and developers who provide support, resources, and libraries.

## What is Bigonoff's tutorial series?
  
Bigonoff's tutorial series is a comprehensive and progressive guide to programming PIC microcontrollers using assembly language. Assembly language is the lowest level of programming language that directly corresponds to the machine code that the microcontroller executes. Although assembly language is more difficult and tedious than higher-level languages such as C or Python, it gives you full control over the hardware and allows you to optimize your code for speed and efficiency.
  
Bigonoff's tutorial series consists of four parts:

1. The first part covers the basics of PIC programming using the PIC16F84 model. It introduces the architecture, instruction set, registers, memory organization, addressing modes, and interrupts of the PIC16F84. It also explains how to use a programmer device to transfer your code to the microcontroller.
2. The second part covers more advanced topics such as arithmetic operations, bit manipulation, subroutines, macros, loops, conditional branching, tables, data structures, etc. It also introduces some common peripherals such as LCD displays, keyboards, serial communication, etc.
3. The third part covers the PIC16F628 model, which is an improved version of the PIC16F84 with more memory, more peripherals, and more features. It explains how to use the new peripherals such as analog-to-digital converters, comparators, PWM modules, etc. It also shows how to use external oscillators and crystal resonators to increase the clock speed of the microcontroller.
4. The fourth part covers the PIC18F family of microcontrollers, which are more powerful and complex than the PIC16F models. It introduces the enhanced instruction set, expanded memory organization, new addressing modes, new peripherals such as USB communication, etc. It also shows how to use C language to program PIC18F microcontrollers using a compiler.

## Why should you read Bigonoff's tutorials?
  
Bigonoff's tutorials are useful for anyone who wants to learn how to program PIC microcontrollers from scratch or improve their skills. Some of the benefits of reading Bigonoff's tutorials are:

- They are written in a clear and concise way that makes them easy to follow and understand.
- They provide many examples and exercises that help you practice and test your knowledge.
- They cover both theory and practice of PIC programming in depth and detail.
- They teach you not only how to write code but also how to design circuits and schematics for your projects.
- They give you tips and tricks on how to optimize your code and avoid 0f148eb4a0
